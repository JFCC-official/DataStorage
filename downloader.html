    <label id=text2>By clicking the "DOWNLOAD NOW" button you will download a zip file called "DS.zip" into your Downloads folder
        that includes everything important for a proper installation of your app. To avoid errors and issues within the app we recommend you 
        to follow these steps carefully:<br><br>
        1) Open the "DS.zip" file <b>within your Downloads folder</b> and extract it all using the same name ("DS") and the same location
        ("Downloads" folder)<br>
        2) Open the extracted folder and click on the "DSDownloader.exe" file<br>
        3) You should find a window on your desktop, that says whether was your app downloaded successfully or not<br>
        4) If the downloading was succesfull you should have the "DataStorage.exe" app on your desktop<br>
        At first your user ID is defined (ID: <b>528546</b>) and underneath you should add your valid Email or Gmail address. You can change all the user information
        in settings opened by clicking the logo in the corner. <br> <br>
        Thank you for downloading our app and we hope you will enjoy using it.
